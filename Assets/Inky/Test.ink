It was the hunter's first time outside Montana.

#b2
He woke, stricken still with the hours-old vision of ascending through rose-lit cumulus,

#p
of houses and barns like specks deep in the snowed-in valleys, all the scrolling country below looking December—brown and black hills streaked with snow,

#b2
flashes of iced-over lakes, the long braids of a river gleaming at the bottom of a canyon.

#p
Above the wing the sky had deepened to a blue so pure he knew it would bring tears to his eyes if he looked long enough.

The airplane descended over Chicago, its galaxy of electric lights,

#b1
the vast neighborhoods coming clearer as the plane glided toward the airport—streetlights, headlights, stacks of buildings, ice rinks, a truck turning at a stoplight, 

#p
scraps of snow atop a warehouse and winking antennae on faraway hills, finally the long converging parallels of blue runway lights, and they were down.

#b1
He walked into the airport, past the banks of monitors.

#b2
Outside the terminal the sky was thick and gray and hurried by wind. Snow was coming.

#p
A woman from the university met him and escorted him to her Jeep. He kept his gaze out the window.

#b2
They were in the car for forty-five minutes, passing first the tall, lighted architecture of downtown,

#p
then naked suburban oaks, heaps of ploughed snow, gas stations, power towers, and telephone wires.

#b1
The woman said, "So you regularly attend your wife's performances?"
