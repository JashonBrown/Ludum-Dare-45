I can’t believe you would just leave a poor old woman out here to die on a walnut shell in the middle of grub knows where!

This has truly been the worst day of my life. I lost two of my legs, I’ve been stuck here for at least thirty seconds and now you won’t even help me even though your boat clearly has room for at least 6 or 7 insects! How do you sleep at night?

I really don’t.
